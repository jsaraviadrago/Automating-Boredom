Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I saw that you studied in KU Leuven in 20XX, I graduated in 20XX. I believe that connecting with professionals like yourself can be incredibly valuable.

I am always eager to expand my network and learn from experienced individuals like you.

I would be honored to connect with you here on LinkedIn and, if convenient for you, explore the possibility of a brief virtual coffee chat (15 minutes).

I am confident that our conversation could be mutually beneficial.

Best regards,
